          Although many non-profits work and partner with the city and county in
          which they reside, all working towards ending homelessness, the
          reality is that an end to homelessness may not be possible, and if it
          is, at the very least as our Lord said "<em
            >The poor you will always have with you</em
          >" (Matthew 26:10-12). They are our brothers and sisters in Christ.
          Regardless of why our brothers and sisters are poor or what their
          condition of life is, they have the inherent right to be able to have
          the necessities for human life that bring dignity and hope.
          <br />
          Here at Mary's Mercy Center we have a constant flow of poor and
          homeless people. The numbers fluctuate from time to time but slight
          decreases are not long lasting. In sharp contrast the needs of the
          poor and homeless have increased dramatically. Where providing food
          and clothing for individuals and families seemed to be enough, now the
          needs have broadened, i.e., there is need for gasoline money at the
          end of the month, the poor cannot always pay all of their rent or
          utilities, cannot afford school backpacks or supplies to put in them,
          there is not enough money to fill prescriptions, no money for car
          repairs, no money for new shoes to replace the severely worn ones.
          Preventative medicine for the poor and homeless is nonexistent, simple
          needs for infants are unaffordable, and the list goes on. There is a
          deepening need among our brothers and sisters. Whether it is seen or
          unseen, the terrible need is there and, sadly, growing.

          Our Story
        </button>
        <p class="collapse" id="ourStory">
          Our journey began in the mid 1980’s with a divinely inspired vision
          shared by members of the Catholic charismatic Renewal Center, under
          the direction of Fr. Michael Barry. Challenged by the example and
          teachings of Jesus, we began to reach out and serve the poor in our
          local communities, working first in local parks with supplies of food
          and money to cover utility bills.
          <br />
          From these early outreach efforts, we moved to open a soup kitchen at
          Our Lady of Fatima Church in San Bernardino. Soon, the Lutheran Church
          of Our Savior added their hands and hearts; and then, Our Lady of
          Guadalupe Church followed with a larger kitchen and dining facility at
          their location. By 1990, Mary’s Table, as the soup kitchen had come to
          be known, had expanded to five days a week and was serving over 5,000
          hot meals each month. It had become a haven, a place of rest,
          fellowship and renewal for many. In 1996, a free medical screening was
          added to Mary’s Mercy Center, which had already expanded to include a
          clothes closet, an emergency food bag program and other services.
          <br />
          Even before this, in 1989, fundraising had begun with the help of the
          300 Club for a major expansion that would become Mary’s Mercy Center.
          In 1992, we purchased our present building and became incorporated as
          a non-profit public benefit corporation, organized exclusively for
          charitable, religious and education purposes. In 1993, the Sisters of
          Charity of the Incarnate Word provided a substantial grant for the
          purchase of an old convent that would be transformed into Veronica’s
          Home of Mercy. Veronica’s Home of Mercy was opened in 1995. Before
          that Casa Merced (a HUD House) opened its doors in 1994. Then in 2009
          Veronica’s Home II opened its doors.
          <br />
          Mary’s Mercy Center currently welcomes approximately 300 volunteers of
          various faiths, schools, and community organizations from throughout
          Southern California. We are proud to network with city agencies,
          county agencies, and other non-profits to direct our clients to
          additional resources. The goal is to restore dignity and purpose to
          the homeless, the poor and the marginalized. Homelessness and poverty
          are complicated issues and the solutions are as varied as the
          individuals we serve. Together we are making a difference in the lives
          of many.

                  Mary's table provides a hot nutritious meal six days a week,
                  including all holidays except Christmas Day. Meals are served
                  to all who come regardless of their situation and no
                  identification is required. After our guests are seated,
                  volunteers serve them their coffee, ice tea, and/or milk.
                  There are no limits on the number of servings for each guest.
                  They are allowed to eat as often as they wish or need to
                  eat.Over 8,000 meals are served each month. Our food comes
                  from many different sources: almost all of our meat is
                  donated; some food and all staples are purchased from food
                  banks, stores and large corporations. We share food among our
                  fellow non-profits when there is an over abundance.

                  St. Martin de Porres Emergency Food Bag Program distributes
                  food bags every Wednesday, except the first Wednesday of the
                  Month. Approximately 1,200 families are helped each month. For
                  those with a facility to cook the bags contain beans, rice,
                  tomato sauce, bread, cereal, fruit, etc. For the homeless and

                  energy bars, peanut butter and jelly, fruit, bread and bottled
                  water. No identification is required to receive assistance.

                  An Annual Christmas Party is held in December. This outreach
                  has grown into a very large and heartwarming event. Thanks to
                  hundreds of generous donors and organizations we are able to
                  serve over 1,300 children and 600 adults. In addition to a
                  warm holiday meal, Mary's Mercy Center gives each child a new
                  wrapped gift and candy. As a special surprise each child
                  participates in a drawing. If their ticket says "WINNER" they
                  receive a larger gift and if the ticket says "BIKE" they
                  receive a new bike. Adults and older teens receive a "shoebox"
                  with toiletries and some special item, a wallet, cologne, or a
                  scarf for example.

                  Veronica's Home of Mercy has never refused admission to any
                  woman because of race, creed or lack of funds<br />
                  Our Program is extensive and comprehensive. Qualified staff
                  provide drug and alcohol counseling, twelve-step meetings,

                  Follow through is very important. It can mean the difference
                  between a resident's success and failure. Casa Merced I, Casa
                  Merced II and Casa Merced III are our re-entry homes. These
                  single-family residential homes are reserved for women who
                  have finished the program at Veronica's Home of Mercy and are
                  doing extremely well but are in need of some assistance until
                  they finish school. These homes provide a more relaxed
                  atmosphere and greater independence. The low rent and access
                  to the support of the staff helps ease the women back into
                  society.

                  We encourage our residents to keep in touch with us. Our
                  staff, in-house classes and activities are readily available
                  to our graduates. If they leave in good standing we invite
                  them to come back and celebrate holidays and birthdays with
                  us. This is especially helpful for those who have no family

                  With 47% of the city residents on welfare, food stamps,
                  Medi-Cal, or a combination thereof; 38% living at or below the
                  poverty level; and over 50% of the population is living at
                  200% of the federal poverty level, San Bernardino is the
                  second poorest city in the nation just behind Detroit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the City of San Bernardino accounts for only 10% of the
                  county’s population it has 40% of its homeless population and
                  approximately 70% are males. The San Bernardino County 2013
                  Homeless Count and Subpopulation Survey found 2,321 homeless
                  individuals throughout the county. Approximately 45% of the
                  homeless population had been homeless for a year or more, 34%
                  abused alcohol and/or drugs and 26% experienced mental
                  illness.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most individuals experiencing homelessness reported a job
                  loss, unemployment or alcohol/drug use as the primary event or
                  condition that led to their homelessness. Without structured,
                  formal, comprehensive support, many of these individuals will
                  remain living on the streets and resort to criminal activities
                  resulting in increased costs to the taxpayers and a decrease
                  in community safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are comprehensive programs for homeless women and
                  homeless women with children however there are no
                  comprehensive housing programs for homeless men in the Central
                  San Bernardino Region.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mary’s Mercy Center has been serving homeless individuals and
                  individuals at-risk of becoming homeless with dignity and
                  respect since 1987. Over the years, thousands of individuals
                  have received hot meals, clothing, supportive services,
                  showers, food, medical and dental services through Mary’s
                  Mercy Center.Since 1995, Mary’s Mercy Center has been
                  providing women and women with children comprehensive,
                  transitional housing services. This program has grown and now
                  serves well over 100 individuals annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2012, with an understanding of the lack of resources for
                  homeless men, Mary’s Mercy Center made a commitment to provide
                  the same high quality, evidence-based programming for men that
                  they do for women. Mary’s Village will provide comprehensive
                  services including behavioral health, medical and other
                  supportive services, at one location. Mary’s Mercy Center is
                  looking forward to working with the community to improve the
                  lives of homeless individuals, thus changing the entire
                  community.”

          By coming on board you become members and part of the ongoing growth
          and development for the vision of Mary's Mercy Center. Since the
          opening of Veronica's Home of Mercy II in late 2009 we have set our
          sights on a shelter for men. The needs of the poor and homeless are
          tremendous, but we do what we can with God's help and your support. It
          is important to note that on average, grants awarded to Mary's Mercy
          Center only account for 40% of the corporation's total budget, and
          that administrative costs are only 9% of the total budget. Mary's
          Mercy Center exists, runs and operates mostly dependent on the mercy
          of God in your heart. Donations and contributions are vital and
          essential.
